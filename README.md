# Hello!! Welcome to my nixos configuration :D I am happy to have you!

I am not a programmer, I can't code, I am a history teacher who likes technology
and hates companies. I like how much I can make Nixos my own, and how easy it is
to reproduce using it.

I don't have time to spend fixing my computer on updates that could break my
machine (why I am not using arch). So I chose nixos, and I do like technology so
I decided to challenge myself even more by using hyprland hehe :D Though I said
I don't have time to waste on arch's updates, I do have time to put work in to
NixOS. This is because I believe that NixOS offers a heavy upfront cost in
exchange for long term payoff. Once I get things configured to a point in which
I like them, I should in theory not have to worry about anything really ever (or
when I do have problems they can be addressed at my leisure and with no haste).
While I know arch takes a lot of upfront work, it would be much easier for me I
am sure to grasp my head around its familiar-ish ways of doing things. But it
likely (imo) would have been easier to get on with my life using arch than
NixOS. I would just in turn have to deal with rolling releases which I don't
think I want to but I digress.

I have flakes, but I don't fully understand them they can make my head hurt. I
also have home-manager :D

I would love any and all help.

PS: If you are reading this on github, it may be worthwhile to know that this
repo is a mirror of a repo I self host on my own gitea instance which is not
publicly accessible. But if you want to contribute I won't say no hehe

  mkOption

### Completed

- ~~configure yazi~~
- ~~port all configs to home-manager~~ happy with this for now, it doesnt need
  to be a big todo i can make it smaller moving forward
- ~~make this (or a new repo, but preferably this) into a dotfiles repo~~
  (essentially because of home-manager it is, just a bad name)
- ~~setup modularity will need help but is important~~
- ~~set up wireguard client~~
- ~~configure wl-clipboard (just figure it out how it works and what it can do
  first)~~
- ~~configure swww~~
- ~~setup screen recording~~
- ~~configure kitty~~ (both kitty, fish, and starship (which ironically isn't

- ~~set up hypr* (shade, cursor, ... )~~
- ~~my desktop configuration is not up to speed yet so get it up to speed)~~

  but it is good enough for now!)
