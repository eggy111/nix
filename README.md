Oh man I dont remember how to use markdown so hopefully this works

# Hello!! Welcome to my nixos configuration :D I am happy to have you!
## I DON'T KNOW WHAT IM DOING
I am not a programmer, I can't code, I am a history teacher who likes technology and hates companies. 
I like how much I can make Nixos my own, and how easy it is to reproduce using it.  I don't have time to spend fixing my computer on updates that could break my machine (why I am not using arch).  So I chose nixos, and I do like technology so I decided to challenge myself even more by using hyprland hehe :D Though I said I don't have time to waste on arch's updates, I do have time to put work in to NixOS.  This is because I believe that NixOS offers a heavy upfront cost in exchange for long term payoff.  Once I get things configured to a point in which I like them, I should in theory not have to worry about anything really ever (or when I do have problems they can be addressed at my leisure and with no haste).  While I know arch takes a lot of upfront work, it would be much easier for me I am sure to grasp my head around its familiar-ish ways of doing things.  But it likely (imo) would have been easier to get on with my life using arch than NixOS.  I would just in turn have to deal with rolling releases which I don't think I want to but I digress.

I have flakes, but I don't understand them they make my head hurt and I try to touch them as little as possible (I fear for when I get nixos on laptop and have two devices).  I also have home-manager which i am slowly learning and liking.  It seems easy enough :D 

I would love any and all help because again **I have no idea what I am doing ever** I am mostly following vimjoyers guides on youtube, and what the lovely people in his discord tell me I should do.  

## My current To Do
- **setup modularity will need help but is important**
- ~~set up screenshots~~
- set up hypridle
- set up hypr* (shade, shot, cursor, ... )
- configure waybar
- configure fish
- configure yazi
- configure notifications
- configure vim (more likely neovim)
- ~~set up wireguard client~~
- ~~configure wl-clipboard (just figure it out how it works and what it can do first)~~
- setup screen recording
- configure rofi
- configure swww
